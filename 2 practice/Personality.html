		<p>Wirt is a pessimistic realist in many ways, but also has a na√Øve and childish side to him. He is easily scared and surprised, and even though he is far more perceptive than his brother, he is very much still a kid. Throughout the storyline of Over the Garden Wall, Wirt has to struggle to remain optimistic against impossible odds. In chapter eight, Babes in the Wood, Wirt finally begins to succumb to his hopelessness and gives up on the notion that he and his brother will ever escape the Unknown. His tendency to think negatively is what made him an easier target for the Beast to drag down into despair. Wirt's brother, Gregory, is a parallel of his brother that pulls out the playful, jovial, childlike side of Wirt.</p>
